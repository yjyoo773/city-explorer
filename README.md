# City Explorer

**Author**: Ellis Yoo
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Using the LocationIQ's API search for a location all around the world. Returns a map of that location.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Packages needed
- React
- Bootstrap React
- Axios

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
Using JavaScript, the application collects data from the user's input. In this case it would be a name of a city or even a landmark. The input is taken in and requests LocationIQ's API for the corresponding data. Then, data including latitude, longitude, and name of the location is returned. We then use that latitude and longitude and request for the map of that location.

## Change Log
